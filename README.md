# Version 0.1.1 (terminal work)
This version can only change the genres of audio files.
Suitable for changing tags for a large number of audio files with the same tag values.



To change genres of your audio files run ```mRedactor.jar``` in terminal using:

```
java -jar mRedactor.jar
```

First you need to type directory path
with your audio files. Then, in turn, specify the genre that will be replaced by the current one.
If you don't want to change current genre, type ```0```.
